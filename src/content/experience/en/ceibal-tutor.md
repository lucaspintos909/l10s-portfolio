As a technical tutor, I led the onboarding and training process of an intern, guiding them from design through implementation of a Full-Stack project, fostering their autonomy and professional development.

**Key responsibilities & achievements:**

- **Full-Stack Mentoring:** Provided continuous guidance in building a robust and interactive backend using FastAPI (Python) and a dynamic frontend based on ReactJS.
- **Review & Quality:** Accompanied the process through code reviews and resolution of technical blockers, accelerating the intern's learning curve.
